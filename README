I used 4 additional functions:
     -> init_info_sensor to initialize the area where the data specific to each type of sensor is kept
     -> print for display according to the requirement according to the type of sensor
     -> check for faulty/correct sensor verification
     -> analyze for calling fct from operations.c according to the passed operator
Main:
     -> open binary file
     -> readings
     -> allocations
     -> addition in vector/ vectors
     -> additional fct calls in fct of the string read from the keyboard
     -> removal from vectors
     -> displacements
     -> closing binary file
